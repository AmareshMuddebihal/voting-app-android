# Appolos - Android #

# Introduction #

Millions of people travel the world each year. They discover new lands, new cultures and news things made locally. Those travelers usually come back home with souvenirs for themselves and their loved ones. On the other hand, there are dozens of millions of people who don't travel for some reason: job, sickness, lack of money etc... Those who don't travel would certainly love to have a souvenir from a distant land but can't get their hands on because of some obstacle. Appolos Inc. wants to help people who don't travel get a souvenir from the land of their dreams. This will be possible through the App Appolos. People who travel can register on this App and people who don't travel can ask them to bring them a souvenir from abroad. Appolos also allows Immigrants to send packages back home through regular travelers. To sum up, Appolos accomplishes two functions in one: 1- Allowing non-travelers to get particular items or souvenirs from anywhere in the world through regular travelers; 2- Allowing immigrants anywhere in the world to send packages to their home country through regular travelers.
